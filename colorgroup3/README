-Example commands that are interesting to view-

-Movie Information-
After #define SAVE_MOVIE is uncommented, movies can be made from the png images by using ffmpeg command:
ffmpeg -i 'movie%d.png' -r 30000/1001 -s hd1080 -vcodec libx264 -bf 0 -crf 16 movie_out.avi
The first 1080p movie I made was done via images from the image sequence generated by this command
./colorgroup -i1920,1080 -o -p1 -r0.9999 -t0.2
